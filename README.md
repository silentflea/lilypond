# Lilypond Compositions!

Here I will add various transcriptions/compositions of music
using the open source program [*LilyPond*](http://www.lilypond.org).

LilyPond is a text-based music engraver; it is more similar to a programming
language than a graphical score editing program.

To run these files, go to the [*LilyPond download page*](http://www.lilypond.org/download.html)
and follow the installations instructions specific to your operating system. Once you have
successfully installed the LilyPond program, simply compile the ".ly" files to export them to pdf
format. Documentation for compiling of LilyPond files can be found [*here*](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/learning-big-page#index).
